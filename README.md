# Go Playground

## Collection of go programs made while learning concepts, practicing new theories, etc.

I wouldn't trust a thing in here as good code, just working (hopefully), it's just practice, which means 2 things are likely:
1) it's not ideally coded
2) once it did what was specifically needed it wasn't looked at again
